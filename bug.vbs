Late Binding: VBScript's late binding can lead to runtime errors if an object or method doesn't exist.  This is especially problematic when dealing with COM objects or external libraries where version compatibility isn't guaranteed.  For example, trying to use a method that's been removed in a newer version of an object library will fail silently or throw a generic error.

Example:
```vbscript
Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
' ... code that assumes objExcel.Workbooks is always available ... 
```
If the Excel version doesn't have the Workbooks property (extremely unlikely but possible with older or customized versions), it could fail unexpectedly.

Implicit Type Conversion: VBScript's loose typing can cause subtle bugs due to implicit type conversion.  Unexpected type conversions might lead to inaccurate calculations or comparisons. 

Example:
```vbscript
Dim strValue
strValue = "10"
decValue = 5
result = strValue + decValue ' result will be "105", not 15
```
The string "10" is concatenated with 5 instead of being implicitly converted to a number.

Error Handling: VBScript's error handling mechanisms (On Error Resume Next, On Error GoTo) can mask errors, making debugging difficult. If not used carefully, they can lead to unexpected behavior and silent failures.

Example:
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Set objFile = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").OpenTextFile("nonexistentfile.txt")
' ... code continues to execute even though the file opening failed ...
```
The script continues to execute despite the file opening failure.

Data Type Mismatches: This is closely related to implicit type conversion, causing unexpected results if not handled correctly. Operations involving differing data types might generate runtime errors or incorrect values.

Example:
```vbscript
Dim myArray(10)
myArray(11) = 10 ' Runtime error: subscript out of range
```
Accessing an array index beyond its bounds will cause a runtime error.

Unclosed Files or Objects: Failure to properly close files or release COM objects can result in resource leaks, slow performance and instability in the system.

Example:
```vbscript
Set objFile = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").OpenTextFile("myfile.txt", 1)
' ...code that processes the file...
'objFile.Close ' Missing close statement!
```
The file may remain open and be unavailable until the script terminates or the system reboots.
