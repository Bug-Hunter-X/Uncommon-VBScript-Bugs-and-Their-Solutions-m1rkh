Improved Error Handling:  Instead of relying on "On Error Resume Next", use structured exception handling:
```vbscript
On Error GoTo ErrorHandler

' ... Your code here ...

Exit Sub
ErrorHandler:
MsgBox "An error occurred: " & Err.Description
Err.Clear
End Sub
```
Explicit Type Declarations: Declare variable types explicitly to avoid implicit type conversion issues:
```vbscript
Dim strValue As String
Dim decValue As Integer
strValue = "10"
decValue = 5
result = CInt(strValue) + decValue  ' result will now be 15
```
Safe Object Handling: Always check if an object exists before accessing its members and ensure proper cleanup:
```vbscript
On Error GoTo objErrorHandler
Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
If Not objExcel Is Nothing Then
  ' Check if Workbooks property exists
  If TypeName(objExcel.Workbooks) = "Workbooks" Then
    'Access Workbooks property
  Else
    MsgBox "Workbooks property is not available in this Excel Version"
  End If 
  objExcel.Quit  'Quit Excel
  Set objExcel = Nothing
End If
Exit Sub

objErrorHandler:
MsgBox "Error: " & Err.Description
Err.Clear
End Sub
```
Array Bounds Checking:  Always validate array indices before accessing them to prevent runtime errors:
```vbscript
Dim myArray(10)
If UBound(myArray) >=11 Then 
   'Handle the case where there is a need to access 11th element of array
Else
   MsgBox "Array index out of range"
End If
```
Resource Management: Ensure that files and objects are closed and released when they are no longer needed:
```vbscript
Set objFile = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").OpenTextFile("myfile.txt", 1)
' ...code that processes the file...
If Not objFile Is Nothing Then objFile.Close
Set objFile = Nothing
```
By implementing these solutions and best practices, developers can make their VBScript code more robust, reliable, and less prone to unexpected errors.
