This repository contains examples of uncommon bugs in VBScript and their solutions.  These bugs often go unnoticed due to VBScript's flexible nature but can cause significant issues in applications.  The examples demonstrate issues with late binding, implicit type conversion, error handling, data type mismatches, and resource management.  Each bug is accompanied by a corresponding solution illustrating best practices for avoiding these problems.
